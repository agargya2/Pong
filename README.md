# Pong for CS Sail

Checkout the demo at https://html5-pong.netlify.app.

Made with HTML5 ```<canvas></canvas>``` and Javascript.

This is a respository for the HTML5 Games course at [CS Sail](https://sail.cs.illinois.edu/) at UIUC.

The started code contains a ```index.html``` file and ```main.js```. The ```main.js``` contains ```TODO (#):``` comments containing instructions on how to code it. If you need help completing it, just check the ```final-code``` directory which contains a working game.

To play the game, open the ```index.html``` file in a browser.
